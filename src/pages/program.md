        Dr. Halpin is a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Auburn University. 
        His teaching interests include power systems, control systems, and network analysis. His research interests are in the areas of power system dynamic performance and power quality.  
        As a Fellow Member, he is active in the IEEE Power Engineering Society where he was the Chair of IEEE 519, in CIGRE where he serves as Convener of the Working Group charged with revising the IEC Technical Reports dealing with emission limits for harmonics, voltage fluctuations, and unbalance, and in IEC where he serves as Chair of TC77/SC77A which is responsible for standardization in all aspects of low-frequency conducted disturbances (power quality) in power systems.

        Dr. Schwanz is a Senior Lead Engineer at the Irish Transmission System Operator (TSO), with a primary focus on the integration of renewable energy sources into power systems and power quality analysis. 
        Currently, she leads studies on power quality at EirGrid, with a particular focus on harmonic solutions and the integration of offshore wind farms. 
        Over the course of her career, she has provided expert advice on mitigation strategies for power quality challenges, conducted in-depth harmonic studies, and supported the development and update of relevant policies. Additionally, she has made significant contributions to the design of harmonic solutions for both power generation and demand customers. 
        Dr. Schwanz is an active member of Cigre Working Group C4.65
